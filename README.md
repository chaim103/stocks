backtesting technical analysis 

strategies im testing.
1. moving avarages: is there any meaning to the window you choose to look back on? does it matter if its a EMA
    will mainly be looking at the strategies that buy/sell during a cross over. and will start with
   SMA: 200, 50, 14 ,10
   EMA: 200, 50, 14 ,10
   if i will be able to make everything done in a normal runtime, then ill check a full range of values.
